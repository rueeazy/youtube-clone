The Odin Project/HTML &amp; CSS - Youtube Player Clone Project

This project is part of The Odin Projects HTML and CSS Curriculum - [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/embedding-images-and-video]

For this project I utilized CSS Grid to build a replica of the youtube player homepage.

Practiced with embedding youtube videos on a web page and formatting a page using HTML, CSS and CSS grid.

The whole website can be viewed here - [https://rueeazy.github.io/youtube-clone/]
